"""Structural + shell sanity tests for every composite action shipped
by the kit.

These tests enumerate every `action.yml` under ``.github/actions/``
plus the root composite, and assert:

* The YAML parses.
* It declares ``runs.using: composite``.
* Every ``inputs.<name>`` is a mapping with a ``description``.
* Every ``outputs.<name>`` is a mapping with a ``description``.
* Every ``run: |`` body whose ``shell`` is bash passes ``bash -n``.
* Every such body passes ``shellcheck -S error`` when shellcheck is
  installed (skipped otherwise so CI without shellcheck still passes).

Together with `test_workflows_structure.py` this is the kit's smoke
test for "did I break a composite by accident".
